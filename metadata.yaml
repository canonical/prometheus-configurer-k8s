  The Prometheus Configurer Charmed Operator provides an HTTP-based API for managing Prometheus 
  alerting rules.
  
  Juju charm in this repository has been designed to supplement prometheus-k8s charm. It leverages 
  the `prometheus_remote_write` interface, provided by the prometheus-k8s, to send over 
  the alerting rules to the Prometheus Server inside the Juju relation data bag.
  
  Full description of the API is available in 
  https://github.com/facebookarchive/prometheus-configmanager/blob/main/prometheus/docs/swagger-v1.yml.
